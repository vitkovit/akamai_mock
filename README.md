Provides option to Select/Unselect All
Selected hostname will show up in WAF Test tab in drop down menu.
Check Live will send ping reqeust to each selected hostname by sending 3 ping reqeusts (use multithread to complete task faster)
Check Edge will use nslookup tool to check if hostname is on Akamai platform by searching keyword "akamai" in CNAME 
it checks hostname by adding edgekey and edgesuite suffixes to nslookup
Set staging - TBD

## Host table 
internal tool that will help manage local host table.
Modify local host table by adding ip and hostname pair (x.x.x.x example.com)
by clicking on Modify Hosts File it will ask for password to keep sudo session and modify table with inserted values

One hostname at the time can be selected.
Toggle between HTTP and HTTPS 
When ready Send Test will send Attack simulated traffic to hostname
Open WSA will open WSA link with multi dimension filter and public IP in main filter.
Suggestion is to use VPN when testing traffic.

## RC Tester 
Test Rate Control for entered hostname.
enter just host in first field and select HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
Path is optional, if not entered it will use root path.
Number of Requests will send up to 100 requests at once, it will open n number of threads.
Number of Seconds will send n number of requests each second.
Possible to select other HTTP Methods
Send will count down number of seconds.
    - backend tool will need to finish the job first, then it will start countdown

## Updates 
Script has local file named version.py where you can see current version of script.
When new version is available on Git it will compare local version with remote version
Download will open browser and allow to download script from git in zip format.
View Ready is what is done now.

## Latest added Feature:
- copy button for each switch key
- error popup if there is no available security configuration

## prerequisites 
Must have active API credentials. To create API credentials, go:
Control Center -> search for "Akamai Technologies - Assets" account ->
navigate to Identity & access -> Create API client.

Once you have proper credentials, make sure you have .edgerc file

File location on MAC: ~/.edgerc

edit file with API credentials:
--- Example of .edgerc file ----
[default]
client_secret = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
host = akab-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
access_token = akab-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
client_token = akab-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

if you use different API Section, make sure you change content of version.py file
- modify variable __apisection__ to the name of your API Section
